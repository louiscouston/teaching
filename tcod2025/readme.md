This is the public repository for the coding/hands-on session on ice-ocean interactions within the Theoretical Challenges for Ocean Dynamics graduate school week, which took place at ENS de Lyon from Nov 17 to 21st 2025.

A big thank you to Keith Nicholls and Pete Davis (British Antarctic Survey), former colleagues, who made the data available and helped me make sense of it.
